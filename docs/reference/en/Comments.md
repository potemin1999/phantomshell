### Comments

There is two most common types of comments, which are used in programming languages "with objects"
Since PSH is have to let you administrate the whole system, and since Phantom OS is not possible without objects, 
our shell should also provide work with object.
That is the reason we agreed that these comment types are quite acceptable

```
// single-line comment 
/* multi-line comment ; <- this semicolon will be also skipped */
```
