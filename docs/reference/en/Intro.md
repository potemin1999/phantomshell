## Phantom Shell

##### REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

Here you can read important things about usage on Phantom shell language and its interpreter  

Phantom Shell can run in two modes: interactive and script-execution (noninteractive) mode. 
Thus we decided to imitate `\n` symbol from scripts files as `;` for interactive mode only. 
You can use it in scripts also, to maintain common style of code, but it is not necessary.
